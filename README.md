Bugs present:
Allies don't retain XP if it's not equal to the XP they need to level up; battle doesn't end properly if an enemy is stunned when killed, lever doesn't work unless the canvas is out of focus
```
Things I'm working on now:
Obstacles
Levels
```

This is a fangame for Brawl Stars, which is a game I have loved since 2019, and I don't think I will ever truly quit it.
This also draws inspiration from Epic Battle Fantasy 5, another one of my favourites, mostly with its key item and obstacle functions.
8-Bit's Adventure can stand alone as its own, unique game, so knowledge is not needed. Enjoy.
