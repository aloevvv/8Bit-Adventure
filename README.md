This is a fangame for Brawl Stars, which is a game I have loved since 2019, and I don't think I will ever truly quit it. This also draws inspiration from Epic Battle Fantasy 5, another one of my favourites, mostly with its key item and obstacle functions. 8-Bit's Adventure can stand alone as its own, unique game, so knowledge is not needed. Enjoy.
