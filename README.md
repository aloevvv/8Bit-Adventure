This is a fangame for Brawl Stars!
Do you prefer graphics over gameplay? Well, this game is not for you! 8-Bit's Adventure is a JRPG-styled game, featuring the journey of 8-Bit, as it grapples
with loss, suddenly thrust into a world full of chaos and despair. With allies that 8-Bit's unsure if it can really even trust.
